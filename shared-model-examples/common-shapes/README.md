# Common Models Package
This package provides an example of how to create a package to share 
common Smithy models.

## Building Package
To build this package run the following from the root of the package:

```
./gradlew clean build
```

This will generate a `build` directory containing the build artifacts generated by
gradle. The generated JAR file that should be used by downstream consumers can be
found at `build/libs/common-shapes.jar`


## Customization
To customize this package, start by updating the `settings.gradle.kts` file and update
the `rootProject.name` property to the desired name of your package.

Then, update the `description` at the top of the `build.gradle.kts` file.

Next, update the validators in the `model/` director to add/remove smithy files to 
define new smithy shapes.

It is also recommended that you update the `model/validators.smithy` file to reflect 
appropriate model validations for your organization. You could also include validation by adding
a common linting configuration package as a dependency of this package.

## Distribution
If you want to distribute the JAR file create by this package, consider adding the
[maven-publish](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html) plugin to the project to 
publish the JAR to a maven repository.
