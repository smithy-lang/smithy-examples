# Custom Validation Decorators Package
Use this example to create a custom validation decorator package for Smithy.

The example contained in this package assumes that the user is using [`Gradle`](https://gradle.org/) as a
build system and Kotlin for the configuration `build.gradle.kts`, when a validation event for an unresolved
shape or trait is found that is recognized, it will add a HINT to the validation event to point the user to
the right way to solve the issue. Something like:

```
You might be missing a dependency to the package `smithy-validation-model`. Try adding `implementation("smithy-validation-model:$smithyVersion")` to the `dependencies` section of your `build.gradle.kts` file
```

And Smithy will add nice formatting to the output. Something similar to the image below.

## Building
To build this package run the following from the root of the package:

```
./gradlew clean build
```

This will generate a `build` directory containing the build artifacts generated by
gradle. The generated JAR file that should be used by downstream consumers can be
found at `build/libs/decorators.jar`
