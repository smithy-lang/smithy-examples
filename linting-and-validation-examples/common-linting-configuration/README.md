# Common Validation Package
Use this package to create a common [linter](https://smithy.io/2.0/guides/model-linters.html?highlight=linter) 
configuration package that can be included as a dependency in other Smithy projects to enforce a common set 
of standards across multiple projects. 

## Building 
To build this package run the following from the root of the package:

```
./gradlew clean build
```

This will generate a `build` directory containing the build artifacts generated by 
gradle. The generated JAR file that should be used by downstream consumers can be 
found at `build/libs/common-linting-configuration.jar`


## Customization 
To customize this package, start by updating the `settings.gradle.kts` file and update
the `rootProject.name` property to the desired name of your package.

Next, update the validators in the `model/validators.smithy` file to include any custom
validations you would like to enforce across projects.

For some examples of custom validators check out [this guide](https://smithy.io/2.0/guides/model-validation-examples.html).

## Distribution
If you want to distribute the JAR file create by this package, consider adding the 
[maven-publish](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html) plugin to the project to publish the JAR to a maven repository.
