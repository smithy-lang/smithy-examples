# Custom Trait with Java validator
Use this package to create a custom trait with a [custom Java validator](https://smithy.io/2.0/guides/model-linters.html#writing-custom-validators). 

## Building
To build this package run the following from the root of the package:

```console
./gradlew clean build
```

This will generate a `build` directory containing the build artifacts generated by
gradle. The generated JAR file that should be used by downstream consumers can be
found at `build/libs/custom-trait-with-java-validator.jar`


## Configuring this example
To configure this example for your own project, start by updating the `settings.gradle.kts` file and update
the `rootProject.name` property to the desired name of your package. Also update the 
`description` at the top of the `build.gradle.kts` file.

Next, update the `model/custom-trait.smithy` file to update the trait definition any
new traits. For more information on defining traits in a Smithy model see: [Defining traits](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/model.html?highlight=annotation#defining-traits). 

Once you have defined your traits in the Smithy model, rebuild the project.

If you updated the Java validator, also update the `io.examples.validators.ResourceMetadataTraitValidator` entry in the 
`src/main/resources/META-INF/services/software.amazon.smithy.model.validation.Validator` service provider file to reflect
any changes to the name and package of your validator.

## Distribution
If you want to distribute the JAR file create by this package, consider adding the
[maven-publish](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html) plugin to the project to publish the JAR to a maven repository.
